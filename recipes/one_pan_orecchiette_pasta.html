        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>
            This delicious orecchiette pasta recipe only has a handful of ingredients, is very cheap to make, and most
            importantly, only uses one pan or pot for the entire procedure. Every year when it's time to go back to
            school I get inundated with requests from students to post recipes that are super-easy, cost pennies, and
            require a bare minimum of kitchen equipment — this is one of them!

        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol type="1">
            <li>
                Heat olive oil in a large, deep skillet over medium heat. Add onion with a pinch of salt; cook and stir
                until onion has softened and turned translucent, about 5 minutes. Stir in sausage and cook until
                browned, 5 to 7 minutes.
            </li>
            <li>
                Pour 1 1/2 cups chicken broth into sausage mixture and bring to a boil while scraping the browned bits
                of food off of the bottom of the pan with a wooden spoon. Add orecchiette pasta; cook and stir pasta in
                hot broth, adding remaining broth when liquid is absorbed, until pasta is cooked through and most of the
                broth is absorbed, about 15 minutes.
            </li>
            <li>
                Stir arugula into sausage-pasta mixture until arugula wilts. Ladle pasta into bowls and sprinkle with
                Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese.
            </li>
        </ol>
